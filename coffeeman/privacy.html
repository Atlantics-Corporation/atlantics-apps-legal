        <h3>1.5 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
        <p><strong>Device-Level Storage:</strong> We store limited data locally on your device using shared preferences (e.g., cached patterns for offline access, sync timestamps, onboarding state). This data does not leave your device unless synced to your account.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>3. How Your Information Is Processed</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Prediction Algorithm</h3>
        <p>Our App uses a Bayesian statistical model to analyze your shopping history and predict when you will need to repurchase items. This processing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Runs on our secure server infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Uses only your own shopping data &mdash; we never combine your data with other users' data for predictions.</li>
            <li>Produces urgency classifications (critical, soon, stocked, learning) to help you plan shopping trips.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Voice Input</h3>
        <p>If you use the voice input feature to add items, speech recognition is processed locally on your device using your operating system's built-in speech recognition capabilities. Audio data is not transmitted to our servers.</p>

        <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We may share your information only in the following limited circumstances:</p>

        <h3>4.1 Service Providers</h3>

        <h3>4.3 Business Transfers</h3>
        <p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>

        <h3>4.4 With Your Consent</h3>
        <p>We may share your information for other purposes with your explicit consent.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Storage Location</h3>
        <p>Your data is stored on Supabase's cloud infrastructure. Supabase uses industry-standard security measures, including encryption at rest and in transit.</p>

        <h3>5.2 Data Isolation</h3>
        <p>All database tables are protected by Row-Level Security (RLS) policies, ensuring that you can only access your own data. No other user can view, modify, or delete your information.</p>

        <h3>5.3 Security Measures</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>HTTPS/TLS encryption for all data transmitted between the App and our servers.</li>
            <li>PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) authentication flow for OAuth sign-in.</li>
            <li>Row-Level Security policies on all database tables.</li>
            <li>Secure token-based session management.</li>
            <li>Password hashing and secure credential storage managed by Supabase Auth.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.4 Security Limitations</h3>
        <p>While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.</li>
            <li><strong>Shopping History:</strong> Your shopping trip data and item patterns are retained indefinitely while your account is active, as they are essential for the App's prediction features.</li>
            <li><strong>After Account Deletion:</strong> When you delete your account, all associated personal data, shopping history, item patterns, preferences, and subscription records are permanently deleted from our servers within 30 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Cached data stored on your device is cleared when you uninstall the App or clear the App's data through your device settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
